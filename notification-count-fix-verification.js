console.log('üîî NOTIFICATION COUNT FIX VERIFICATION')
console.log('=' * 50)

console.log('\nüìã Fixed Issues:')
console.log('‚úÖ Changed notification count logic to prioritize local count over socket count')
console.log('‚úÖ Added immediate API refresh after marking notifications as read')
console.log('‚úÖ Improved logging for debugging count updates')

console.log('\nüîß Key Changes Made:')
console.log('1. Modified unreadCount calculation in notifications-dropdown.tsx:')
console.log('   - Local count now takes precedence when notifications are loaded')
console.log('   - Socket count only used when no local notifications available')
console.log('')
console.log('2. Enhanced markAsRead function:')
console.log('   - Added immediate count refresh from API after successful read')
console.log('   - 100ms delay to ensure database update completes')
console.log('')
console.log('3. Enhanced markAllAsRead function:')
console.log('   - Added immediate count refresh from API after successful bulk read')
console.log('   - Better error handling and user feedback')

console.log('\nüß™ Expected Behavior After Fix:')
console.log('1. ‚úÖ Notification count decreases immediately when marking as read')
console.log('2. ‚úÖ Count goes to 0 when marking all as read')
console.log('3. ‚úÖ No need to refresh page to see count updates')
console.log('4. ‚úÖ UI stays in sync with actual read status')

console.log('\nüéØ Testing Instructions:')
console.log('1. Open the application in your browser')
console.log('2. Create some test notifications (use Test button in dev mode)')
console.log('3. Click on individual notifications to mark as read')
console.log('4. Verify count decreases immediately')
console.log('5. Use "Mark all as read" button')
console.log('6. Verify count goes to 0 immediately')

console.log('\nüìä Benefits of This Fix:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Immediate visual feedback when marking notifications as read')
console.log('‚Ä¢ No dependency on socket connection for UI updates')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Better user experience with real-time count updates')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Fallback mechanism ensures count stays accurate')

console.log('\nüîç Monitoring:')
console.log('Check browser console for these log messages:')
console.log('- "Using local count: X" (should show correct count)')
console.log('- "Refreshed notification count after mark as read: X"')
console.log('- "Successfully marked notification as read"')

console.log('\n‚ú® The notification count should now update immediately without needing to refresh!')
