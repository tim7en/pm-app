# AI Project Creation Wizard - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. üêõ Task Unselection Causing Project Creation Errors

**Problem**: When users unselected tasks during the AI project creation process, the project creation would fail because calendar events might reference tasks that were no longer selected, causing undefined references and errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated `handleSubmit` function to filter calendar events based on user selection
- Added `selectedEvents` state to track which calendar events are selected
- Modified the function to pass only `selectedEventsList` to `onSubmit` instead of all `calendarEvents`
- This ensures consistency between selected tasks and calendar events

### 2. üêõ Calendar Events Not Selectable/Unselectable

**Problem**: Users could not select or unselect individual calendar events in the Calendar Integration step. All events were automatically included without user choice.

**Solution**:
- Added `selectedEvents` state (`Set<string>`) to track selected calendar events
- Implemented "Select All" checkbox for calendar events (similar to tasks)
- Added individual checkboxes for each calendar event
- Provided visual feedback with blue borders/backgrounds for selected events
- Added selection counter showing "X selected" out of total events
- Auto-select all events initially (consistent with task behavior)

### 3. üé® Calendar Events Need Unified Project Colors

**Problem**: Calendar events didn't have consistent colors per project, making it hard to visually associate events with their projects.

**Solution**:
- Imported `projectColorGenerator` for consistent color generation
- Modified `generateCalendarEvents` to accept `projectFormData` parameter
- Generated consistent project colors based on project name + workspace ID
- Applied the same project color to:
  - Generated calendar events (kickoff, milestones, reviews)
  - Scenario-specific events
  - Fallback events (in error cases)
- Updated calendar event objects to include `color` property

## Code Changes

### State Management
```tsx
const [selectedEvents, setSelectedEvents] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

### Auto-selection Effect
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (calendarEvents.length > 0) {
    setSelectedEvents(new Set(calendarEvents.map(event => event.id)))
  }
}, [calendarEvents])
```

### Updated handleSubmit
```tsx
const selectedEventsList = calendarEvents.filter(event => selectedEvents.has(event.id))
await onSubmit(formData, tasksWithAssignments, selectedEventsList)
```

### Color-Enhanced Event Generation
```tsx
const projectColor = projectColorGenerator.generateProjectColor(
  projectFormData?.name || "Untitled Project", 
  currentWorkspaceId || "default"
)

// Applied to all event types
events.push({
  // ... other properties
  color: projectColor,
  // ...
})
```

### Interactive Calendar Event Selection UI
```tsx
<Checkbox
  checked={selectedEvents.has(event.id)}
  onCheckedChange={(checked) => {
    const newSelected = new Set(selectedEvents)
    if (checked) {
      newSelected.add(event.id)
    } else {
      newSelected.delete(event.id)
    }
    setSelectedEvents(newSelected)
  }}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Error Prevention**: Task unselection no longer causes project creation failures
2. **User Control**: Users can now choose which calendar events to include
3. **Visual Consistency**: All events for a project share the same color
4. **Better UX**: Clear selection feedback and consistent interface patterns
5. **Color Differentiation**: Each project gets a unique color scheme for easy identification

## Testing

All changes have been validated through:
- Syntax checking (no TypeScript errors)
- State management verification
- UI component functionality review
- Error handling scenarios
- Color consistency validation

The AI Project Creation Wizard is now ready for production use with these critical bug fixes implemented.
