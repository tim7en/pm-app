# üß™ NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - MANUAL TESTING GUIDE

## üöÄ Pre-Testing Setup

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Server should start on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Socket.IO should be accessible at `ws://localhost:3000/api/socketio`

2. **Verify Database Connection**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Check that `.env.local` has correct `DATABASE_URL`

## üìã Manual Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Basic Functionality Tests

**Test 1: Notification Loading**
- [ ] Open app in browser at `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Click the notification bell icon
- [ ] Verify existing notifications load correctly
- [ ] Check that notification count badge shows correct number

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Notifications load from database, count is accurate

**Test 2: Test Notification Creation**
- [ ] Click "Test" button in notifications dropdown
- [ ] Verify new notification appears immediately
- [ ] Check that notification count badge increments
- [ ] Verify notification has correct timestamp

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ New notification appears instantly without page refresh

**Test 3: Mark as Read Functionality**
- [ ] Click on an unread notification
- [ ] Verify notification is marked as read (visual indicator changes)
- [ ] Check that notification count badge decrements
- [ ] Verify read status persists after page refresh

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Read status updates immediately and persists

### ‚úÖ Real-time Integration Tests

**Test 4: Task Assignment Notifications**
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Assign task to another user
- [ ] Verify assignee receives notification immediately
- [ ] Check notification contains task title and assignment info

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Assignee gets instant notification about new task

**Test 5: Comment Notifications**
- [ ] Add comment to a task
- [ ] Verify task assignee/owner receives notification
- [ ] Check notification contains commenter name and task info
- [ ] Verify comment content is visible in notification

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Relevant users get instant comment notifications

### ‚úÖ Multi-tab Real-time Sync Tests

**Test 6: Multi-tab Synchronization**
- [ ] Open app in multiple browser tabs
- [ ] Create notification in one tab
- [ ] Verify notification appears in all other tabs instantly
- [ ] Mark notification as read in one tab
- [ ] Verify read status syncs across all tabs

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ All tabs stay synchronized in real-time

**Test 7: Connection Recovery**
- [ ] Open app in browser
- [ ] Disconnect internet connection
- [ ] Reconnect internet
- [ ] Verify Socket.IO reconnects automatically
- [ ] Test that notifications still work after reconnection

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ System recovers gracefully from connection issues

### ‚úÖ Browser Notification Tests

**Test 8: Browser Permission Handling**
- [ ] Grant browser notification permission when prompted
- [ ] Create a test notification
- [ ] Verify browser notification appears (outside app)
- [ ] Click browser notification to verify it opens app

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Browser notifications work when permissions granted

**Test 9: Permission Denied Handling**
- [ ] Deny browser notification permission
- [ ] Verify app still functions normally
- [ ] Check that in-app notifications still work
- [ ] Verify no error messages appear

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ App gracefully handles denied permissions

### ‚úÖ Performance & Load Tests

**Test 10: Rate Limiting Validation**
- [ ] Rapidly click "Test" button multiple times
- [ ] Verify rate limiting prevents spam (max 60/hour)
- [ ] Check that error message appears when limit exceeded
- [ ] Verify normal functionality returns after limit resets

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Rate limiting protects against abuse

**Test 11: Large Notification List**
- [ ] Create many notifications (20+)
- [ ] Verify dropdown performance remains smooth
- [ ] Check that scrolling works properly
- [ ] Test that marking multiple as read works

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Performance remains optimal with many notifications

### ‚úÖ Security Tests

**Test 12: Authentication Protection**
- [ ] Try accessing `/api/notifications` without authentication
- [ ] Verify access is denied (401 Unauthorized)
- [ ] Login and verify access is granted
- [ ] Logout and verify access is denied again

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ All endpoints properly protected

**Test 13: XSS Protection**
- [ ] Try creating task with HTML/script tags in title
- [ ] Create comment with potential XSS content
- [ ] Verify notifications display safely (no script execution)
- [ ] Check that HTML is sanitized or escaped

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ XSS attempts are neutralized

### ‚úÖ Error Handling Tests

**Test 14: Network Error Handling**
- [ ] Disable network connection
- [ ] Try to load notifications
- [ ] Verify user-friendly error message appears
- [ ] Reconnect and verify recovery

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with user feedback

**Test 15: Invalid Data Handling**
- [ ] Send malformed requests to API endpoints (use dev tools)
- [ ] Verify proper error responses (400 Bad Request)
- [ ] Check that app doesn't crash or show cryptic errors
- [ ] Verify error logs are appropriate

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Invalid requests handled gracefully

## üéØ Success Criteria

### All tests should demonstrate:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates**: No page refresh needed
- ‚úÖ **Data persistence**: Changes survive page refresh
- ‚úÖ **Cross-tab sync**: All tabs stay synchronized
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Smooth operation under normal load
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Protected against common attacks
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Graceful degradation on failures
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üö® Red Flags (Immediate Issues)

If any of these occur, system needs immediate attention:
- ‚ùå Notifications don't load
- ‚ùå Real-time updates not working
- ‚ùå App crashes or shows error pages
- ‚ùå Authentication bypass possible
- ‚ùå XSS vulnerabilities present
- ‚ùå Memory leaks in browser dev tools
- ‚ùå Database errors in console
- ‚ùå Socket.IO connection failures
