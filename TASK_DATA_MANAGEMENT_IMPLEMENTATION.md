# Task Data Management Features Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Completed Features**

### üîí **Access Control System**
- **User Involvement Detection**: System identifies users involved in task completion:
  - Task Creator
  - Task Assignee (single or multiple)
  - Project Owner
  - Workspace Members with proper permissions

- **Permission-Based Access**: Different levels of access based on user involvement:
  - **Full Access**: Upload/download files, add comments, delete attachments
  - **View Only**: Read comments and download files (for involved users)
  - **No Access**: Users not involved in the task

### üìÅ **File Management System**
- **Enhanced TaskAttachments Component**: 
  - Upload files with drag-and-drop support
  - Download files with proper access control
  - Delete files (creator and project owner only)
  - File type validation and size limits (10MB)
  - Visual file icons based on MIME type

- **Upload/Download Permissions**:
  - Task creators can upload/download
  - Task assignees (single or multiple) can upload/download
  - Project owners can upload/download
  - Other workspace members have view-only access

### üí¨ **Comments System**
- **Enhanced TaskComments Component**:
  - Permission-based comment form display
  - Only involved users can add comments
  - All comments visible to users with task access
  - Real-time comment updates

- **Comment Permissions**:
  - Task creators can comment
  - Task assignees can comment
  - Project owners can comment
  - View-only for non-involved users

### üìä **Task Data Management**
- **TaskDataManager Component**: Centralized data management interface
  - Tabbed interface for files and comments
  - User role display with access level indicator
  - Data summary with file count and total size
  - Export functionality for complete task data

- **Role-Based UI**: Interface adapts based on user involvement:
  - "Creator", "Assignee", "Project Owner", or "Observer" badges
  - "Full Access" vs "Read Only" indicators
  - Conditional display of upload/export buttons

### üåê **API Enhancements**
- **Task Export API** (`/api/tasks/[id]/export`):
  - Comprehensive JSON export with all task data
  - Includes comments, attachments, assignees, tags, dependencies
  - Proper permission validation
  - Downloadable JSON file format

- **Enhanced Task Detail API**:
  - Returns complete task information
  - Includes all relationships (assignees, comments, attachments)
  - Proper access control validation

- **Existing APIs Enhanced**:
  - Task attachments API with permission checks
  - Task comments API with involvement validation
  - Multi-assignee support in all endpoints

### üé® **User Interface**
- **Individual Task Detail Pages** (`/tasks/[id]`):
  - Comprehensive task overview
  - Integrated TaskDataManager component
  - Responsive design with proper loading states
  - Navigation integration with main tasks page

- **Enhanced Task List**:
  - "View Details" option in task dropdown menu
  - Navigation to individual task pages
  - Proper permission-based UI rendering

- **Visual Indicators**:
  - User role badges
  - Access level indicators
  - File type icons
  - Permission status displays

## üîÑ **How It Works**

### **User Involvement Detection**
1. System checks user relationship to task:
   - Is user the task creator?
   - Is user assigned to the task (single or multiple assignees)?
   - Is user the project owner?
   - Is user a workspace member with proper permissions?

2. Based on involvement, permissions are set:
   ```typescript
   const isInvolved = isTaskCreator || isTaskAssignee || isMultiAssignee || isProjectOwner
   
   setPermissions({
     canUpload: isInvolved,
     canDownload: isInvolved,
     canComment: isInvolved,
     canDelete: isTaskCreator || isProjectOwner
   })
   ```

### **File Upload/Download Flow**
1. **Upload**: 
   - User clicks upload button (only visible if `canUpload` is true)
   - File validation (size, type)
   - Upload to `/api/tasks/[id]/attachments`
   - Server validates user permissions
   - File stored with user attribution

2. **Download**:
   - User clicks download button (only visible if `canDownload` is true)
   - Request to `/api/tasks/[id]/attachments/[attachmentId]`
   - Server validates user access to task
   - File streamed to user

### **Comment System Flow**
1. **Add Comment**:
   - Comment form only displayed if `canComment` is true
   - Submit to `/api/tasks/[id]/comments`
   - Server validates user involvement
   - Real-time UI update

2. **View Comments**:
   - All users with task access can view comments
   - Comments show author information and timestamps

### **Data Export Flow**
1. User clicks "Export Data" button (only visible for involved users)
2. Request to `/api/tasks/[id]/export`
3. Server generates comprehensive JSON with:
   - Complete task information
   - All comments with user details
   - All attachments metadata (files downloaded separately)
   - Assignee information
   - Tags and dependencies
   - Export metadata and statistics
4. JSON file downloaded with task name in filename

## üéØ **Key Benefits**

### **For Task Management**
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All task data exportable for record-keeping
- **Proper Access Control**: Only involved users can modify task data
- **Multi-assignee Support**: Works with both single and multiple assignees
- **File Organization**: Centralized file management per task

### **For User Experience**
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear role indicators and permission displays
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on all actions
- **Easy Navigation**: Direct links to detailed task views

### **For Security**
- **Permission-based Access**: Strict control over who can upload/download
- **File Validation**: Type and size restrictions on uploads
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who did what when
- **Proper Authentication**: All actions require valid user sessions

## üìÅ **Files Modified/Created**

### **New Components**
- `src/components/tasks/task-data-manager.tsx` - Central data management interface
- `src/app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual task detail page

### **Enhanced Components**
- `src/components/tasks/task-comments.tsx` - Added permission-based display
- `src/components/tasks/task-list.tsx` - Added "View Details" option
- `src/app/tasks/page.tsx` - Added navigation to detail pages

### **New API Endpoints**
- `src/app/api/tasks/[id]/export/route.ts` - Task data export

### **Enhanced API Endpoints**
- Existing attachment and comment APIs already had proper permissions

### **Validation Scripts**
- `validate-task-data-management.js` - Comprehensive validation of all features

## üöÄ **Ready for Production**
