## üöÄ Deployment Commands Summary

### Initial Setup (First Time Only)
```bash
# 1. Download and run setup script
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/pm-app/main/deploy-ubuntu-20.04.sh
sudo chmod +x deploy-ubuntu-20.04.sh
sudo ./deploy-ubuntu-20.04.sh

# 2. Clone application
sudo git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pm-app.git /opt/pm-app
cd /opt/pm-app

# 3. Configure environment
sudo nano .env.production

# 4. Start application
sudo systemctl start pm-app
```

### Regular Updates
```bash
cd /opt/pm-app
sudo git pull origin main
sudo ./deploy-quick.sh
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status pm-app

# View logs
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml logs -f

# Test health endpoint
curl -f https://198.163.207.39/api/health

# Check containers
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml ps
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Security First**: Always use HTTPS in production and keep secrets secure
2. **Database Separation**: Use external managed database for production
3. **Backup Everything**: Automated backups are configured but test restoration
4. **Monitor Resources**: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and disk usage
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep system packages and Docker images updated
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test in staging before production deployment
