# AI Task Generation Improvements

## Issue Identified
The AI project creation wizard was generating tasks that were heavily focused on software development, regardless of the project category selected by the user. This happened because the AI mock data only contained 3 software-focused scenarios:

1. **E-commerce Platform** - Web development tasks
2. **Mobile Fitness App** - Mobile development tasks  
3. **AI Chatbot** - AI/ML development tasks

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Non-Technical Project Scenarios

Added 3 new project scenarios focused on common business and research needs:

#### üìä Market Research Study (`research-project`)
- **Focus**: Research projects, data analysis, surveys
- **Sample Tasks**: Literature review, survey design, data collection, statistical analysis, report writing
- **Use Cases**: Market research, academic studies, user research, competitive analysis

#### üìù Project Concept Note Development (`concept-note-development`)  
- **Focus**: Project proposals, concept papers, documentation
- **Sample Tasks**: Problem analysis, stakeholder mapping, solution design, budget development, risk assessment
- **Use Cases**: Grant proposals, project concepts, strategic planning documents

#### üìö Professional Training Program Development (`training-program`)
- **Focus**: Educational content, curriculum design, learning programs
- **Sample Tasks**: Needs assessment, curriculum design, content creation, assessment methods, pilot testing
- **Use Cases**: Corporate training, educational courses, skill development programs

### 2. Enhanced AI Matching Logic

Improved the AI scenario selection algorithm to better match user intent:

#### Category-Based Matching (Primary)
```typescript
if (category === 'research') ‚Üí Research Project
if (category === 'design') ‚Üí Concept Note Development  
if (category === 'training') ‚Üí Training Program
if (category === 'marketing') ‚Üí Marketing Campaign
if (category === 'event') ‚Üí Event Planning
if (category === 'business') ‚Üí Business Development
if (category === 'software') ‚Üí Software scenarios (with sub-matching)
```

#### Description-Based Matching (Fallback)
```typescript
Keywords: 'research', 'study', 'analysis' ‚Üí Research Project
Keywords: 'concept', 'proposal', 'note' ‚Üí Concept Note Development
Keywords: 'training', 'education', 'learning' ‚Üí Training Program
Keywords: 'marketing', 'campaign' ‚Üí Marketing Campaign
// ... and so on
```

#### Improved Default Behavior
- **Before**: Always defaulted to e-commerce platform (software)
- **After**: Defaults to research project (more general/applicable)

### 3. Task Quality Improvements

Each new scenario includes:
- **Realistic Tasks**: Non-technical, business-oriented tasks
- **Proper Dependencies**: Logical task sequencing
- **Varied Categories**: Planning, Research, Analysis, Documentation, etc.
- **Appropriate Timelines**: Realistic effort estimates for each task type
- **Relevant Calendar Events**: Stakeholder meetings, reviews, milestones

## Example Task Generation Results

### Before (All Projects ‚Üí Software Tasks)
- "Project Setup and Architecture Planning"
- "Database Schema Design" 
- "User Authentication System"
- "Frontend UI Components Library"
- "Payment Integration"

### After (Research Project ‚Üí Research Tasks)
- "Research Scope and Methodology Definition"
- "Literature Review and Secondary Research"
- "Survey Design and Questionnaire Development"
- "Primary Data Collection"
- "Data Analysis and Statistical Processing"

### After (Training Program ‚Üí Educational Tasks)
- "Training Needs Assessment"
- "Learner Profile and Audience Analysis"
- "Curriculum Structure and Module Design"
- "Content Development and Materials Creation"
- "Pilot Testing and Feedback Collection"

## Impact

‚úÖ **Diverse Task Generation**: AI now generates appropriate tasks for 7 different project types
‚úÖ **Better User Experience**: Tasks match user's actual project needs
‚úÖ **Non-Technical Focus**: Supports business, research, and educational projects
‚úÖ **Intelligent Matching**: Uses both category and description to select appropriate scenarios
‚úÖ **Realistic Workflows**: Tasks follow logical business processes, not just software development cycles

## Testing Recommendations

To test the improvements:

1. **Create Marketing Project**: Select "Marketing Campaign" category ‚Üí Should generate marketing tasks
2. **Create Research Project**: Use keywords like "study", "research", "analysis" ‚Üí Should generate research tasks  
3. **Create Training Project**: Select "Training & Education" category ‚Üí Should generate educational tasks
4. **Create Concept Note**: Use keywords like "proposal", "concept note" ‚Üí Should generate documentation tasks

The AI will now provide much more relevant and actionable task suggestions for diverse project types beyond just software development.
