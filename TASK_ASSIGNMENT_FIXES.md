# Task Assignment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **"member.user.id" Error**
**Problem**: Several components were trying to access `member.user.id` but the API returns a flattened structure with `member.id`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `/src/components/tasks/task-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx` 
- `/src/components/projects/create-project-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/projects/ai-project-creation-wizard.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `WorkspaceMember` interfaces to match API response structure
- Changed `member.user.id` → `member.id`
- Changed `member.user.name` → `member.name`
- Changed `member.user.email` → `member.email`
- Changed `member.user.avatar` → `member.avatar`

### 2. ✅ **Task Reassignment Not Working**
**Problem**: Task reassignment was using old PATCH `/api/tasks/{id}` endpoint instead of new assignment endpoints.

**Files Fixed**:
- `/src/components/tasks/task-reassign-dialog.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated to use `POST /api/tasks/{id}/assign` for assignment
- Updated to use `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}/assign` for unassignment
- Added proper error handling and success messages

### 3. ✅ **Mock Members Management**
**Problem**: Too many mock members (5) and no way to clear them.

**Files Updated**:
- `/src/app/api/workspaces/[id]/seed-mock-members/route.ts`
- `/src/app/team/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Reduced mock members from 5 to 3
- Added DELETE endpoint to clear all mock members
- Added "Clear Mock Members" button to Team page
- Mock members are now properly removed from workspace and deleted if not in other workspaces

## Current Mock Members (3 Total)

1. **Alex Johnson** (member-1) - alex@company.com
2. **Sarah Chen** (member-2) - sarah@company.com  
3. **Michael Rodriguez** (member-3) - michael@company.com

## API Endpoints

### Task Assignment
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/assign` - Assign task to user
- `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}/assign` - Unassign task

### Mock Member Management
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/seed-mock-members` - Add 3 mock members
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}/seed-mock-members` - Remove all mock members

## How to Test

1. **Clear any existing mock members**: Team page → "Clear Mock Members"
2. **Add fresh mock members**: Team page → "Add Mock Members" 
3. **Test task assignment**: Go to any task → Edit → Change assignee to a mock member
4. **Verify notifications**: Check that assigned users receive notifications
5. **Test project selection**: Edit task → Change project (should work without errors)

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No more "member.user.id" errors
- ✅ Task assignment works with mock members
- ✅ Project selection in task editing works
- ✅ Notifications sent when tasks are assigned
- ✅ Only workspace members appear in assignment dropdowns
- ✅ Easy management of mock members (add/clear)

## Error Handling

All API calls now include proper error handling with:
- Informative error messages
- Success notifications with details
- Proper permission checks
- Fallback error responses
