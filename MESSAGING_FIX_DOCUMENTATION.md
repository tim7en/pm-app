# Team Chat Message Persistence Fix

## Problem Resolved
âœ… **Fixed**: Messages sent to offline users are now properly delivered when they come back online.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added proper `Conversation`, `ConversationParticipant`, and `Message` models to Prisma schema
- Added `ConversationType` enum for different conversation types
- Established proper foreign key relationships between users, conversations, and messages

### 2. API Implementation
- Completely rewrote `/api/messages/internal/route.ts` to use persistent database storage
- Replaced in-memory arrays with proper database queries
- Added support for both direct messages and group conversations
- Implemented proper unread message counting based on user's last read timestamp

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Message Persistence**: All messages are now stored in the database permanently
- **Offline Message Delivery**: When users come online, they see all messages sent while they were offline
- **Unread Count**: Proper counting of unread messages based on user's last read time
- **Group Chat Support**: Full support for group conversations with multiple participants
- **Read Status Tracking**: Automatic marking of messages as read when users view conversations

## How Message Delivery Now Works

1. **Sending Messages**:
   - Messages are immediately saved to the database
   - Conversation is created or updated automatically
   - All participants are linked to the conversation

2. **Coming Online**:
   - User's conversation list shows all conversations they participate in
   - Unread count shows messages sent since their last read time
   - Messages persist across sessions and browser refreshes

3. **Reading Messages**:
   - When user opens a conversation, their "lastReadAt" timestamp is updated
   - Unread count automatically decreases for that conversation

## Database Tables Created

### `conversations`
- `id`: Unique conversation identifier
- `name`: Optional name for group conversations
- `isGroup`: Boolean indicating if it's a group chat
- `type`: INTERNAL or EXTERNAL conversation type
- `createdAt/updatedAt`: Timestamps

### `conversation_participants`
- `conversationId`: Links to conversation
- `userId`: Links to user
- `joinedAt`: When user joined the conversation
- `lastReadAt`: Last time user read messages in this conversation

### `messages`
- `id`: Unique message identifier
- `content`: The message text
- `conversationId`: Which conversation the message belongs to
- `senderId`: Who sent the message
- `isRead`: Global read status (currently unused, per-user read status tracked via lastReadAt)
- `createdAt/updatedAt`: Timestamps

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open two browser windows** (or use incognito mode for second user)
2. **Login as User 1** in first window
3. **Login as User 2** in second window
4. **Send message from User 1 to User 2**
5. **Close User 2's browser** (simulate going offline)
6. **Send more messages from User 1**
7. **Reopen User 2's browser and login**
8. **User 2 should see all messages** including those sent while offline

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/messages/internal`
- Returns all conversations for the authenticated user
- Includes unread count for each conversation
- Shows last message preview

### GET `/api/messages/internal?conversationId={id}`
- Returns all messages for a specific conversation
- Automatically marks messages as read for the current user

### POST `/api/messages/internal`
- Sends a new message
- Creates conversation if it doesn't exist
- Supports both direct messages and group messages

#### Direct Message Example:
```json
{
  "receiverId": "user-id-here",
  "content": "Hello!"
}
```

#### Group Message Example:
```json
{
  "receiverIds": ["user1-id", "user2-id", "user3-id"],
  "content": "Hello everyone!",
  "isGroup": true
}
```

## Technical Notes

- Messages are never lost once sent (persistent storage)
- Unread counts are calculated dynamically based on user's lastReadAt timestamp
- Group conversations automatically include all specified participants
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Automatic conversation creation for new message threads

The messaging system now provides reliable offline message delivery and proper conversation persistence across user sessions.
