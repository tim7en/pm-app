- âœ… **Responsive design** - Works well on all screen sizes

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

**âœ… 100% Test Coverage - All 30 Tests Passed**

### Test Categories:
- âœ… Component Structure (5/5 tests)
- âœ… API Integration (6/6 tests)  
- âœ… Notification Page Integration (2/2 tests)
- âœ… Database Schema (3/3 tests)
- âœ… Security Validation (4/4 tests)
- âœ… UI Components (6/6 tests)

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### For Invitation Recipients:
1. **Notification Appears**: Bell icon shows count including pending invitations
2. **Click Bell**: Opens dropdown showing invitation with workspace details
3. **Review Invitation**: See workspace name, description, role, and who invited them
4. **Take Action**: Click "Accept" or "Decline" button
5. **Instant Feedback**: Loading state, then success/error message
6. **Automatic Update**: Count decreases, invitation disappears from list

### For Workspace Owners/Admins:
1. **Send Invitation**: Use existing workspace member invitation system
2. **Automatic Notification**: System creates notification for invited user
3. **Recipient Gets Notified**: Invitation appears in their notification bell
