# Multi-Assignee Task Management & Access Control Implementation

## üìã Overview
This implementation adds support for multiple assignees per task and ensures that invited team members can only see projects and tasks they are explicitly part of, providing proper access control and security.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Task Assignees
- **Database Schema**: Added `TaskAssignee` model for many-to-many relationship
- **API Support**: Tasks can now be assigned to multiple users simultaneously
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy `assigneeId` field maintained for compatibility
- **UI Updates**: Task dialog now supports multi-select assignee interface

### 2. Proper Access Control for Invited Members
- **Project Visibility**: Invited members only see projects they are explicitly part of
- **Task Visibility**: Members only see tasks they are assigned to or created
- **Workspace Boundaries**: Clear separation between workspace access levels

### 3. Permission System
- **Workspace Owners/Admins**: Can assign tasks to any workspace member
- **Project Owners**: Can assign tasks in their projects to any workspace member  
- **Regular Members**: Can only assign tasks to themselves (unless they own the project)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Model: TaskAssignee
```prisma
model TaskAssignee {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  taskId    String
  userId    String
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())
  assignedBy String?

  // Relations
  task       Task  @relation(fields: [taskId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user       User  @relation("TaskMultiAssignee", fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  assignedByUser User? @relation("TaskAssignedBy", fields: [assignedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  @@unique([taskId, userId])
  @@map("task_assignees")
}
```

### Updated Task Model
```prisma
model Task {
  // ... existing fields ...
  assigneeId    String?           // Legacy field (kept for backward compatibility)
  assignees     TaskAssignee[]    // New: support for multiple assignees
  // ... other relations ...
}
```

### Updated User Model
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing relations ...
  taskAssignees     TaskAssignee[]  @relation("TaskMultiAssignee")
  assignedTasksBy   TaskAssignee[]  @relation("TaskAssignedBy")
  // ... other relations ...
}
```

## üîß API Changes

### New Endpoints

#### Task Assignees Management
- `GET /api/tasks/[id]/assignees` - Get task assignees
- `POST /api/tasks/[id]/assignees` - Add assignees to task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]/assignees` - Remove assignees from task

#### Request/Response Examples

**Adding Multiple Assignees:**
```json
POST /api/tasks/task123/assignees
{
  "userIds": ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "3 user(s) assigned to task",
  "assignments": [
    {
      "id": "assign1",
      "taskId": "task123",
      "userId": "user1",
      "user": {
        "id": "user1",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }
    }
    // ... more assignments
  ]
}
```

### Updated Endpoints

#### Task Creation
- `POST /api/tasks` - Now accepts both `assigneeId` (legacy) and `assigneeIds` (new)
- Automatically creates `TaskAssignee` records for multiple assignees
- Sends notifications to all assigned users

#### Project & Task Filtering
- `GET /api/projects` - Now filters projects based on explicit membership
- `GET /api/tasks` - Now filters tasks based on assignment and project access

## üé® Frontend Changes

### Task Dialog Component
- **Multi-Select Interface**: New assignee selection component with badges
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still populates legacy `assigneeId` field
- **Permission-Based UI**: Shows different options based on user role

#### UI Features:
- Selected assignees displayed as removable badges
- Dropdown filters out already-selected assignees
- Visual feedback for permission levels
- Support for both single and multiple assignee selection

### Enhanced Components
- **Task Cards**: Display multiple assignees with avatars
- **Project Views**: Respect membership-based filtering
- **Dashboard**: Shows only relevant tasks and projects

## üîê Access Control Logic

### Project Access
```typescript
// For invited members, only show projects they are explicitly part of
return db.project.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { ownerId: userId },                    // Projects they own
      { members: { some: { userId } } },      // Projects they're members of
      { 
        AND: [
          { workspaceId: { in: workspaceIds } },
          {
            workspace: {
              members: {
                some: {
                  userId,
                  role: { in: ['OWNER', 'ADMIN'] }  // Workspace owners/admins see all
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

### Task Access
```typescript
// For invited members, only show tasks they are assigned to or created
return db.task.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { assigneeId: userId },                           // Legacy single assignee
      { assignees: { some: { userId } } },              // New multi-assignee
      { creatorId: userId },                            // Tasks they created
      { project: { ownerId: userId } },                 // Tasks from owned projects
      { project: { members: { some: { userId } } } },   // Tasks from member projects
      // Workspace owners/admins see all tasks in their workspaces
      {
        project: {
          workspace: {
            members: {
              some: {
                userId,
                role: { in: ['OWNER', 'ADMIN'] }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

## üìù Permission Matrix

| User Role | Project Access | Task Access | Assignment Permissions |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Workspace Owner** | All workspace projects | All workspace tasks | Can assign to any workspace member |
| **Workspace Admin** | All workspace projects | All workspace tasks | Can assign to any workspace member |
| **Project Owner** | Owned + member projects | All project tasks | Can assign in owned projects |
| **Project Member** | Member projects only | Assigned + created tasks | Can only assign to self |
| **Invited Member** | Explicitly joined projects | Assigned tasks only | Can only assign to self |

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy Support**: Existing `assigneeId` field maintained
- **Automatic Migration**: Existing single assignees automatically get `TaskAssignee` records
- **API Compatibility**: Both old and new assignee formats supported

### Data Migration
```sql
-- Automatically create TaskAssignee records for existing assignments
INSERT INTO task_assignees (taskId, userId, assignedAt, assignedBy)
SELECT id, assigneeId, createdAt, creatorId 
FROM tasks 
WHERE assigneeId IS NOT NULL;
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Multi-assignee task creation
- ‚úÖ Assignee management (add/remove)
- ‚úÖ Access control for invited members
- ‚úÖ Permission restrictions for regular members
- ‚úÖ Project and task visibility filtering
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility with legacy assignments

### Test Script
Run the test suite: `node multi-assignee-test-suite.js`

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Create a test workspace with multiple members
   - Create tasks with multiple assignees
   - Verify access control works as expected

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Assignee Roles**: Different roles for assignees (primary, reviewer, etc.)
- **Assignment Workflows**: Approval workflows for task assignments
- **Notification Preferences**: Per-assignee notification settings
- **Assignment Analytics**: Track assignment patterns and workload distribution

### Advanced Features
- **Bulk Assignment**: Assign multiple tasks to multiple users
- **Assignment Templates**: Save common assignment patterns
- **Workload Balancing**: Automatic assignment based on current workload
- **Assignment History**: Track all assignment changes over time
