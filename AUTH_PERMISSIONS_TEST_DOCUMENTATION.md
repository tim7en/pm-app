# 🔐 Authentication & Permissions Test Results

## Test Suite Overview

**Test Suite**: Comprehensive Authentication & Permissions Testing  
**File**: `auth-permissions-test-suite.js`  
**Date**: Generated dynamically  
**Purpose**: Validate complex multi-user permission scenarios

## Test Scenario Description

### Multi-User Permission Testing Scenario

1. **User Creation**:
   - **AdminUser**: Workspace owner with full permissions
   - **Member1**: Regular team member
   - **Member2**: Regular team member who also owns a workspace

2. **Workspace Setup**:
   - AdminUser creates "Shared Team Workspace" and invites Member1 and Member2
   - Member2 creates "Personal Workspace" and invites Member1
   - All invitations are accepted

3. **Project Structure**:
   - AdminUser creates project in shared workspace with Member1 (MEMBER) and Member2 (MANAGER)
   - Member2 creates project in personal workspace with Member1 (VIEWER)

4. **Task Assignment**:
   - AdminUser creates tasks in shared project assigned to both members
   - Member2 creates task in personal project assigned to Member1

5. **Permission Validation**:
   - Test workspace access boundaries
   - Test project role-based permissions  
   - Test task access and modification rights
   - Verify proper access denial for unauthorized operations

## Expected Test Results

### Permission Matrix

| User | Workspace Access | Project Access | Task Access | Notes |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **AdminUser** | ✅ Shared (Owner)<br>❌ Member2 Personal | ✅ Shared Project (Owner)<br>❌ Member2 Project | ✅ All tasks in owned projects | Full owner permissions |
| **Member1** | ✅ Shared (Member)<br>✅ Member2 Personal (Member) | ✅ Shared Project (MEMBER)<br>✅ Member2 Project (VIEWER) | ✅ View all<br>✅ Edit assigned<br>❌ Edit in viewer projects | Cross-workspace member |
| **Member2** | ✅ Shared (Member)<br>✅ Personal (Owner) | ✅ Shared Project (MANAGER)<br>✅ Personal Project (Owner) | ✅ All tasks as manager/owner | Manager in shared, owner in personal |

### Detailed Permission Tests

#### Workspace Permissions
1. **AdminUser accessing shared workspace** → ✅ **PASS** (Owner)
2. **Member1 accessing shared workspace** → ✅ **PASS** (Invited member)
3. **Member1 accessing Member2 personal workspace** → ✅ **PASS** (Invited member)
4. **AdminUser accessing Member2 personal workspace** → ❌ **PASS** (Properly denied)

#### Project Permissions
1. **AdminUser GET shared project** → ✅ **PASS** (Owner)
2. **Member1 GET shared project** → ✅ **PASS** (Project member)
3. **Member2 PUT shared project** → ✅ **PASS** (Manager role)
4. **Member1 GET Member2 project** → ✅ **PASS** (Viewer role)
5. **Member1 PUT Member2 project** → ❌ **PASS** (Viewer role - properly denied)
6. **AdminUser GET Member2 project** → ❌ **PASS** (Not invited - properly denied)

#### Task Permissions
1. **Member1 viewing assigned task** → ✅ **PASS** (Task assignee)
2. **Member1 updating assigned task** → ✅ **PASS** (Task assignee)
3. **Member1 viewing other task in same project** → ✅ **PASS** (Project member)
4. **Member1 viewing task in Member2 project** → ✅ **PASS** (Project viewer)
5. **Member1 updating task in Member2 project** → ❌ **PASS** (Viewer role - properly denied)

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Validation

### Workspace Roles
- **OWNER**: Full control over workspace, projects, and members
- **ADMIN**: Administrative privileges within workspace
- **MEMBER**: Standard workspace access
- **GUEST**: Limited read-only access

### Project Roles
- **ADMIN**: Full project control
- **MANAGER**: Project management with member control
- **OFFICER**: Task management capabilities
- **MEMBER**: Standard project participation
- **VIEWER**: Read-only project access

### Permission Inheritance
- Workspace membership grants basic project access
- Project roles override workspace permissions for specific projects
- Task assignment grants modification rights regardless of project role
- Owners always have full access to their owned resources

## Security Validation

### Access Control Tests
✅ **Cross-workspace isolation**: Users cannot access workspaces they weren't invited to  
✅ **Role-based restrictions**: Lower roles cannot perform higher-level actions  
✅ **Data isolation**: Users only see data from their accessible workspaces/projects  
✅ **Authentication requirements**: All operations require valid JWT tokens  

### Data Protection Tests
✅ **User data isolation**: Users cannot access other users' personal information  
✅ **Workspace boundaries**: Clear separation between different workspaces  
✅ **Project access control**: Fine-grained permissions within projects  
✅ **Task assignment validation**: Only authorized users can modify tasks  

## Test Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Database properly configured and accessible
3. Authentication system fully functional

### Running the Tests
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/timursabitov/Dev/pm-app

# Make the test script executable
chmod +x auth-permissions-test-suite.js

# Run the comprehensive test suite
node auth-permissions-test-suite.js
```

### Expected Output
The test suite will:
1. Create 3 test users with proper authentication
2. Set up complex workspace and project relationships
3. Execute 30+ permission validation tests
4. Provide detailed success/failure reporting
5. Clean up test data after execution

## Test Data Structure

### Created Test Users
```json
{
  "admin": {
    "name": "Admin User",
    "email": "admin@pmapp-test.com",
    "role": "OWNER"
  },
  "member1": {
    "name": "Member One", 
    "email": "member1@pmapp-test.com",
    "role": "MEMBER"
  },
  "member2": {
    "name": "Member Two",
    "email": "member2@pmapp-test.com",
    "role": "MEMBER"
  }
}
```

### Workspace Structure
```
Shared Team Workspace (AdminUser owner)
├── AdminUser (OWNER)
├── Member1 (MEMBER) - invited
└── Member2 (MEMBER) - invited

Member2 Personal Workspace (Member2 owner)
├── Member2 (OWNER)
└── Member1 (MEMBER) - invited
```

### Project Structure
```
Shared Team Project (in Shared Workspace)
├── AdminUser (Project Owner)
├── Member1 (MEMBER role)
└── Member2 (MANAGER role)

├── Member2 (Project Owner)
└── Member1 (VIEWER role)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure development server is running on port 3000
2. **Authentication Failures**: Check JWT secret is properly configured
3. **Database Errors**: Verify database schema is up to date
4. **Permission Denied**: Confirm role-based access control is implemented

### Debug Information
The test suite provides detailed logging including:
- API call details and responses
- User context switching information
- Permission test results with explanations
- Test data creation and cleanup logs

## Post-Test Verification

After successful test execution:
1. ✅ All test users are properly created and authenticated
2. ✅ Complex workspace relationships are established
3. ✅ Project hierarchies work across workspaces
4. ✅ Task assignment and permissions function correctly
5. ✅ Security boundaries are properly enforced
6. ✅ Test data is cleaned up automatically

This comprehensive test suite validates that the PM-App authentication and permission system can handle complex multi-user, multi-workspace scenarios while maintaining proper security and data isolation.
