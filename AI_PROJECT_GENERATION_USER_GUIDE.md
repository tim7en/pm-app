- Consistent user experience across all languages

## 🔧 Error Handling Testing

### Test Error Scenarios
1. **Network Failure Simulation**: 
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Go to Network tab → Block network requests
   - Try generating AI tasks
   - Should see fallback task generation with user-friendly error message

2. **Invalid Input Testing**:
   - Leave required fields empty
   - Enter very short descriptions (< 10 characters)
   - Test with special characters or very long text
   - Verify form validation and error messages

3. **API Timeout Simulation**:
   - The system includes realistic delays (2.5 seconds for analysis, 1.5 seconds for task generation)
   - Loading states should be visible throughout the process
   - User should see progress indicators and status updates
