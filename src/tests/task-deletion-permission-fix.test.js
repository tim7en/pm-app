/**
 * TEST: Task Deletion Permission Bug Fix
 * =====================================
 * 
 * This test verifies the fix for the bug where users couldn't delete tasks
 * they created if they were also assigned to those tasks.
 * 
 * Bug Description:
 * - If a task was assigned to the user AND created by the user
 * - The user couldn't delete the task from the project
 * - This was due to incorrect permission logic priority
 * 
 * Fix:
 * - Creator permissions now have higher priority than assignee permissions
 * - If user created the task, they can delete it regardless of assignment
