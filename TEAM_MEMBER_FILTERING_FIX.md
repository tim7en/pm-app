# Team Member Filtering Fix - Error Resolution

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a runtime error: `"Error: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'member.user.id')"` in the my-tasks filtering functionality.

## Root Cause
The error was occurring in `/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` in the `fetchUsers` function where the code was trying to access `member.user.id` instead of the correct `member.id` property.

## Data Structure Context
The application has two different data structures for member objects depending on the API endpoint:

### 1. Workspace Members API (`/api/workspaces/[id]/members`)
Returns **flattened** structure:
```json
{
  "id": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "avatar": "avatar.jpg",
  "role": "MEMBER",
  "joinedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Project Members API (`/api/projects/[id]/members`)
Returns **nested** structure:
```json
{
  "id": "member123",
  "userId": "user123", 
  "role": "MEMBER",
  "user": {
    "id": "user123",
    "name": "John Doe", 
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "avatar": "avatar.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Fix Applied

### File: `/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` - Line 169
**Before:**
```typescript
const users = data.map((member: any) => ({
  id: member.user.id,
  name: member.user.name || member.user.email,
  email: member.user.email,
  avatar: member.user.avatar || "",
  role: member.role,
  joinedAt: member.joinedAt
}))
```

**After:**
```typescript
const users = data.map((member: any) => ({
  id: member.id,
  name: member.name || member.email,
  email: member.email,
  avatar: member.avatar || "",
  role: member.role,
  joinedAt: member.joinedAt
}))
```

## Components That Use Each Structure

### Flattened Structure (workspace members API):
- ✅ `/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` - **FIXED**
- ✅ `/src/app/team/page.tsx` - Already correct
- ✅ `/src/components/dashboard/team-members.tsx` - Already handles both structures
- ✅ `/src/components/messages/team-chat-dialog.tsx` - Already correct
- ✅ `/src/components/tasks/task-reassign-dialog.tsx` - Already correct

### Nested Structure (project members API):
- ✅ `/src/components/projects/project-members.tsx` - Correctly uses nested structure

## Validation
- The fix ensures that the tasks page correctly accesses member properties from the workspace members API
- No changes needed to project member components as they use a different API with nested structure
- All filtering operations in my-tasks should now work correctly without runtime errors

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The error `"undefined is not an object (evaluating 'member.user.id')"` has been fixed by updating the data access pattern to match the API response structure.
